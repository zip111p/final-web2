## 🚨 Things to Check Before Demo

```bash
# Server status
npm start                    # Should show:
                            # ✅ Server running on port 3000
                            # ✅ Session store: MongoDB
                            # ✅ Authentication: Enabled

# Database
db.movies.count()           # Should return: 23
db.users.count()            # Should return: 3
db.sessions.count()         # Should return: 1+ (growing during demo)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep DevTools open during demo** (F12)
   - Show cookies
   - Show network requests
   - Show console logs

2. **Take your time explaining security**
   - Graders love security knowledge
   - HttpOnly and CSRF are important topics

3. **Test each CRUD operation fully**
   - Read: Show all 23 movies
   - Create: Add new movie
   - Update: Edit title and rating
   - Delete: Confirm action

4. **Demonstrate authorization**
   - Try editing another user's movie
   - Show "You can only edit your own movies"
   - This shows deep understanding

5. **Answer questions confidently**
   - You know the code inside-out
   - You implemented security properly
   - You can explain every design decision

## 🎬 Example Answers

**Q: "How do sessions work?"**
A: "When user logs in, we create a session in MongoDB. The session ID is sent to browser as HttpOnly cookie. On each request, Express checks if session is valid and loads user data."

**Q: "What is HttpOnly flag?"**
A: "It prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie. If attacker injects malicious code, they can't read the session ID. This protects against XSS attacks."

**Q: "Why bcrypt?"**
A: "Bcrypt is slow by design (uses salt + key stretching). Even if database is compromised, passwords are impossible to crack. We use 10 salt rounds for maximum security."

**Q: "Show authorization in action"**
A: "Try to delete another user's movie. The server returns 403 Forbidden because userId doesn't match. Users can only modify their own data."
