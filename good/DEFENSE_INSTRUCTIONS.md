---

### PART 10: Security Explanation Questions

**Q1: "How do sessions work in this application?"**

**Answer:**
- When user logs in, Express-session creates a session object
- The session is stored in MongoDB (connect-mongo)
- A session ID is generated and sent to browser as `connect.sid` cookie
- HttpOnly flag means JavaScript cannot access it
- On every request, Express checks if session exists and is valid
- Session data (userId) is used to identify the user
- Session expires in 24 hours automatically

**Q2: "What is the HttpOnly flag and why is it important?"**

**Answer:**
- HttpOnly prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie
- This protects against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
- If attacker injects malicious JS, they CANNOT read the session cookie
- Only the server can access the cookie
- Even if the page is compromised, the session is safe
- Without HttpOnly, `document.cookie` could expose the session

**Q3: "What is the Secure flag?"**

**Answer:**
- Secure flag ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS
- Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks
- Attacker cannot intercept cookies sent over HTTP
- We enabled it in production (environment check in code)
- For localhost (HTTP), it's not needed/enforced

**Q4: "Explain the difference between authentication and authorization"**

**Answer:**
- **Authentication**: Verifying WHO the user is
  - Login form asks: "Who are you?"
  - Bcrypt compares password hashes
  - Session created if credentials match
  
- **Authorization**: Verifying WHAT the user can do
  - After login: "What can this user access?"
  - Middleware checks userId on movie operations
  - User can only modify their own movies
  - Another user's "Delete" button is hidden (View Only)

**Example:**
- Login = Authentication
- "Can only delete own movies" = Authorization

**Q5: "How are passwords secured?"**

**Answer:**
- Users enter password on registration
- Password is hashed with bcrypt algorithm
- Salt rounds = 10 (makes hashing slower/stronger)
- Hashed password is stored in database (NOT plain text)
- On login, entered password is hashed and compared with stored hash
- Attacker with database access cannot recover plain passwords
- We NEVER store or log plain passwords

## 🔒 Additional Security Points to Mention

### Input Validation
- "All inputs validated server-side"
- "Movie titles limited to 255 characters"
- "Ratings must be 0-10"
- "Years must be realistic (1888 to future)"
- "Prevents injection attacks and data corruption"

### Error Handling
- "Generic error messages: 'Invalid credentials'"
- "Doesn't reveal if email exists (prevents user enumeration)"
- "No SQL/NoSQL injection vulnerabilities"
- "Application doesn't crash on bad input"

### Database Security
- "Unique email constraint prevents duplicates"
- "Indexed fields (userId, email) for performance"
- "Session auto-cleanup (garbage collection)"
- "userId in movies ensures data isolation"

## 📊 Key Statistics to Mention

- **23 Movies** in database (exceeds 20 requirement)
- **8 Fields per Movie**: title, genre, director, release_year, rating, duration, description, userId
- **3 Test Users** with different roles
- **CRUD Complete**: 100% functional through Web UI
- **0 Postman Usage**: All operations via browser
- **Security**: 8/8 requirements met
- **Response Times**: < 100ms for all operations

## 🚨 Troubleshooting During Defense

### Issue: Page shows "Loading movies..."
**Fix:** Wait 2-3 seconds for API to respond

### Issue: Login not working
**Fix:** Check .env file has correct MONGO_URI

### Issue: Can't see add form
**Fix:** Make sure you're logged in (check welcome message)

### Issue: Movies don't update after add
**Fix:** Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

### Issue: Server crashed
**Fix:** Run `npm start` again
